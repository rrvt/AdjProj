# Adjust Visual Studio 17 Project File

Sort the file names by the name of the file rather than the "path\filename".  Sorts the Resource Files
in the order "...rc", "...rc2", image file.  Unfortunately, the sections are sorted separately due
to the organization of the project file.

## Getting Started

Build with Visual Studio 2017.  Execute.  The open file icon is used to open the ".vcxproj" file.  The
crossed tools will do the adjustment.  The result can be examined in the window, the files are near the
bottom of the file, scroll down.  The third toolbar image of a floppy disk will save the file backing up
the original before writing.

### Installing

The ...msi file will install the application.

## Running the tests

Copy an vcxproj file into the data directory and practice with it.
